door-decs
=========

Generate door decorations for university resident halls.

about
-----

door-decs is an excuse to mess around with `canvas` and the HTML drag
and drop libraries. This project also uses the following kick-ass
libraries / frameworks:

- bootstrap and the flatly bootstrap theme
- font-awesome (icons)
- d3.js (for .csv parsing)

directions
----------

Load `index.html`. Drag-and-drop a .csv describing some residents, and a pretty picture. Hit 'Build door decs'. Then print, setting the page orientation to landscape. Done.

A sample image and residents.csv file are under `/fixtures`.

future
------

- TODO improve load-data, build-pics, and directions/help UX
- TODO image resizing and limits
- TODO clean up README (links, directions, etc.)
- customization of appearance/settings?
